## Type annotation

 We’re going to finish our look at data types by examining type annotation, which is Swift’s way of letting us dictate exactly what data type each variable and constant should be. Once that’s done we’ll summarize what’s covered, then try another checkpoint so you can evaluate what you’ve learned so far.
